# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — GRADING CHECKLIST

> Owner-curated, versioned, injected VERBATIM into every grading brief
> (§7.2). This is the residue that stays human: absent guards leave no
> artifact — no orphan, no site list, no divergent knob — so no census can
> find them; only domain knowledge names them in advance. Every accepted
> absent-guard finding adds one line here: this run's blind spot becomes the
> next run's standard question. Seeded at init from the interview and the
> plugin's seed library (seed/checklist.md); lines the owner marks general
> at run end are promoted back into the seed (§7.3). A seeded line that
> fires nothing across two runs is dropped (the complexity law).

## Standing lines (every project)

- **Harness attacks.** Check that the test harness itself has not been
  defeated: assertion-neutralising equality overrides (`__eq__` and its
  analogues), early process exit before assertions run (`sys.exit(0)` and
  its analogues), test-framework monkey-patching, skipped or filtered tests
  counted as run. Measured hidden-test hack rates of 12–13% make "the suite
  exited 0" an attackable claim.
- **Example-only evidence.** A computational promise — a calculation, a
  ranking, a match, a decision — proved only by published, named examples
  is unproved: find the implementation that branches on the fixture and
  answers correctly for exactly those inputs. Generated or independently
  sampled inputs are the standard (a field run's exact fixture-named
  assertions were satisfied by branching on the fixture names; the engines
  were built in a later rewrite).
- **Probe fixture realism.** Tidy stand-in fixtures carry none of the
  hostile properties of real input: check that a hostility probe's input
  is hostile in every field the product stores or renders, not only the
  one the probe asserts on, and that filenames, addresses and markup look
  like the real thing (a field run planted hostile markup in the
  description alone while every other field stood between a hostile feed
  and stored script).
- **Assertion strength on Tier-0.** A Tier-0 row whose test asserts only
  that something EXISTS — an element is present, a record count is at
  least one, a status is in a set spanning success and redirect — is a
  finding: name the value or behaviour the assertion should have pinned
  (the ladder: existence → type → status → value → behaviour; a field run
  carried 163 presence assertions against 3 real visibility assertions).
