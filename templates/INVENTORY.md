# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — TEST INVENTORY

> Ratified at init, same standing as PRD.md: the owner ratified these ROWS —
> what will be verified — before any code existed. Mechanically derived from
> three enumerable sets (PRD requirements + Fail-ifs; design pack @screen
> markers via the resolved design-join table; the scaffold's route table via
> the ratified routes extractor), plus the auth-state × surface axis and the
> genus-row proposals (origin: domain). Rows are generated, never authored;
> only exceptions are hand-touched. Additions during development are
> permitted, never silent — checks/inventory.sh fails a commit whose new
> route has no row here, and every change to this block is a law change:
> a standalone commit, nothing else in it (pre-commit, §4.1). Development is
> "make the ledger green": every row below was materialised as a failing
> ledger test at init (proved red — the red gate), or carries
> `owed: <reason>` until its test can exist.

## Row schema

    ROW-NNN | kind | subject | actor/state | marker | obligation | derived-from | test

- `kind` — `surface` · `journey` · `shell` · `behavior` · `reachability`
- `subject` — route (`/account`, in the scaffold's own literal form), screen
  id, or requirement id
- `actor/state` — `anonymous` · `candidate` · `operator:<role>` · `n/a` ·
  `(process)` (v0.9.3 3.2, R3: a machine journey or a trigger row — the
  product acting on what enters at an external input boundary, with no
  person at a browser)
- `marker` — the design pack marker this row binds to (`P03/expired`), or `n/a`
- `obligation` — one falsifiable sentence a fresh-context grader can check
- `derived-from` — `REQ-NNN` and/or a design marker; never "authored"
- a **journey** row's obligation carries the narrative followed by
  `transitions:` — one numbered item per transition, `<actor> at <state>
  · <entry control> · <action> · <next state> · <observable effect>`
  (v0.9.2 3.5, R8); an `(off_screen)` phase stays in the narrative and is
  no transition. The row is paid per transition, in a real browser,
  operating the real control; setup may reach the starting state through
  the API or a fixture and never performs a transition; the verdict pass
  returns one verdict per transition and the row is KEPT only when every
  transition is.
- a **machine journey** (v0.9.3 3.2, R3) is a journey row with actor
  `(process)`: every external input boundary ARCHITECTURE.md declares
  (feeds, uploads, webhooks, scheduled pulls, inbound mail) × every
  observable consequence the PRD promises for what enters there
  (searchable, matched, notified, exported, expired, deleted); its
  `transitions:` are the stages as the PRD states them (enter · parse ·
  store · index · notify · expire), each with its observable effect; paid
  per stage at the boundary's real entry point, the external party played
  by the harness's fake (itself a `difference` row), never a browser.
- **the deployed population** (v0.9.3 3.3, R4): every row of kind
  `journey`, and every row whose actor is `(process)`, is paid by the close
  run's deployed pass — the product's declared processes running on the
  same image, nothing inline — and that report alone is its receipt (a row
  absent from it is red, whatever the inline report says). Scoped runs stay
  inline.
- `test` — path under tests/invariants/, or `owed: <reason>` (owed rows block
  completion — checks/inventory.sh --strict and checks/coverage.sh --strict).
  One owed reason has its own standing (v0.9.1 3.6): `owed: paid by /vid
  deploy gate <1|2|3> — <what the rung observes>` — a row whose obligation
  can only be observed through something the harness substitutes (a DIF
  row's paying step, a seam with `credentials: not-yet`, a deployed
  worker consuming a schedule). Reported as `deploy-owed`, outside the
  owed gaps; completion requires it present and named, never silently
  absent; it is paid only by that rung's evidence and stamped `| paid-at:
  gate-N <date> <deploy log row>` in a law commit. Any other shape in this
  field is a GAP, never silent — a typo'd path must not exit the evidence
  join.

  **Deferral is a closed vocabulary (v0.9.2 3.2, R3).** Under a block
  whose first line inside the fence is `grammar: 0.9.2` — or `grammar:
  0.9.3`, which carries every 0.9.2 rule — an owed reason
  reads `owed: <class> — <detail>`, the class one of the table below and
  the detail naming the missing dependency and its payment point; a legal
  word alone does not pass, and any other reason is a GAP at every commit
  (`unclassed deferral`, checks/inventory.sh). "Materialised when its
  surface exists", "lands with the screen's slice", "in the slice that
  builds the subject" are not classes: they describe a red test — a test
  against a missing route or marker IS a red test, and is written. A
  block without the line keeps the pre-0.9.2 reading (any reason,
  reported).

  | class | when it is legal | detail must name |
  |---|---|---|
  | `guard-first` | a hostility probe or control sibling whose guard does not exist yet | the protection row; paid in the slice that builds it |
  | `census-armed` | a rule row before any site exists; and a rule row during a sanctioned rule-shaped repair (every enumerated site being guarded — citing a test arms the census at once) | for the repair: `sites being guarded, fix <finding id>`; paid by the owed→path flip once every site is guarded |
  | `probe-capture` | a seam probe awaiting the capture | the seam id; paid before the first client line, or at deploy gate 2 (R15) |
  | `golden-set` | the row awaits its ratified golden set | the fixture path to be ratified |
  | `fixture-source` | a fixture from an external source not yet held | the source; when it is expected |
  | `prerequisite` | a fixture or interface contract the harness lacks (a test-author pass's `unwritable: missing prerequisite`) | what is missing; paid at which slice or boundary |
  | `owner-decision` | the existing visible-debt class | `OQ-n` |
  | `reverted` | **legacy** — written by 0.9.2's develop at the two-attempt bound; 0.9.3 never writes it (a row past the bound stays materialised and is held, below) and an upgraded project keeps the rows it has | the verdict's one-line reason, quoted |
  | `paid by /vid deploy gate <1\|2\|3>` | the v0.9.1 deploy-owed form above, verbatim | what the rung observes (its own `deploy-owed=N` and `paid-at:` semantics, never re-classed) |

  The par (v0.9.2 R4): checks/inventory.sh prints `par: rows=R
  materialised=N legitimate=K (by class) deploy-owed=D other=J` under the
  line, and the red gate fails while `J > 0` or `N + K + D ≠ R` — every
  row is materialised or legitimately deferred, and the count of
  legitimate deferrals is printed at the gate. A surface row may be
  deferred ONLY as `prerequisite` naming a harness fixture the state
  needs and the harness lacks; a missing route, a 404 or a missing
  marker is a failing case of the surface instrument, never a deferral.

**A row's verdicts (v0.9.3 3.6, 3.7; R8–R11).** Under `grammar: 0.9.3` a
materialised row is ledger-tested only when its cases pass in the current
receipt AND its latest verdict is KEPT (`checks/coverage.sh --strict`,
per row, whatever the row derives from). KEPT means the promise holds in
the product AND the test observes it. BREACHED carries its class:
`product` (the product violates the Fail-if), `test` (the test cannot
observe the promise — it asserts what was already true, stops before the
effect, binds the wrong boundary) or `harness` (the instrument failed); a
row whose transitions differ takes `product` if any transition's latest
breach is, else `test`, else `harness`. A `test` or `harness` breach costs
no attempt and leaves the row `unverdicted` until a fresh verdict. Rounds,
attempts and holds are computed from the verdict events by
`checks/metrics.sh`, never written: two `product` rounds since the row's
latest KEPT, reissue or amendment hold it (`reason=bound`), two `test`
rounds likewise (`reason=test`), two `harness` rounds with no harness
repair between them (`reason=harness`). A held row stays materialised —
this field unchanged, no law commit — counts `breached`, is left out of
the automatic claim and waits for the owner; an owner answer
(`reissued`), an amendment, or a KEPT from a fix's blind re-grade releases
it. An amended obligation, or a changed `fail-if:` of the item a row
derives from, wipes the row's verdicts and its attempt history
(`checks/hooks/post-commit` records `amended row=ID sha=<commit>`); a
verdict quoted before the amendment does not count.

Every row may carry optional trailing labeled fields, in any order:

- `| origin: REQ-NNN | domain | finding-NNN | derivation <date>` — provenance:
  which requirement, genus-row proposal, grade finding, or re-derivation
  sitting produced the row.
- `| paid-at: gate-N <date> <deploy log row>` — on a deploy-owed row, the
  rung that paid it (v0.9.1 3.6); written by /vid deploy, never by a
  sandbox run.
- `| proved-red: <commit-sha>` — the commit at which the row's test was
  observed failing (§3.6). Init stamps it for materialised rows; a test added
  later records the parent commit where it was red. A row test with no
  proved-red has the same standing as `owed` — an unproved test is not
  evidence, and checks/inventory.sh counts it accordingly. The stamp is
  joined, not merely present (v0.8.1d): the sha must resolve, the cited
  file must exist at it, and the file there must name the row (its ROW id
  or its `derived-from` REQ id) — a sha at which the test was never red
  is a GAP. Cited test paths resolve against the commit under construction
  (the staged index, then HEAD), never the working tree: the rhythm is
  test (free ledger addition, observed red) → row (law commit, stamped with
  the parent) → code.
- `| golden: tests/invariants/<fixture>` and `| divergence: DIF-NNN` —
  on a row derived from a `derives: golden-set` item: the ratified golden
  set the row's test reads (one line per query: `query | must-appear |
  must-outrank | must-not-appear`, proposed by a fresh-context lens, never
  by the build or tuning context), and the difference row that legalises
  a model or engine divergence on that path. A named DIF must exist and
  carry a `paying-step:` (below) — checks/inventory.sh joins the two.

**Row shapes with no new class (v0.8.1d).** One row per independently
breakable promise of a requirement's complete block — the ROW is the
atomic unit, no sub-ids. A **trigger-existence row** (kind `behavior`,
subject the item, actor `(process)` under `grammar: 0.9.3` — so the
deployed pass pays it) for every time-worded Fail-if. A **volume row** per
list surface once a scale item exists. A **control sibling** of every
guard/never row — the allowed case demonstrably works, effect observed —
an ordinary ROW, `derived-from` the same REQ, obligation opening
`control of ROW-NNN: …`. **Property-form rows** through the public
surface: many-input datasets, and the four invariance relations —
reorder-invariance, rename-invariance of aggregates, repeat-idempotence,
unrelated-state-unchanged — each a falsifiable predicate over the
product's own outputs, never a reference implementation.

**Two tiers.** `tests/invariants/` is the ledger and the only tier rows
cite. `tests/scaffolding/` is the builder's non-law tier: implementation-
keyed instruments, never cited, never evidence, outside the coverage join,
proved-red, the extractors and the deletion tripwire; deletable without a
law commit; never run by the gate. Every fixture file under `tests/`
opens with a one-line `Provenance:` header — `hand-authored`, `captured
from <seam probe>`, or `generated by <generator path under tests/>` — so
a fixture whose expected value the system under test produced (circular)
is visible to the vacuity extractor.

## Census row classes (v0.7 — read by checks/census.sh)

    rule       | RULE-NNN | statement | census-command | tier | test
    difference | DIF-NNN  | knob | test-value | prod-value | why-safe [| paying-step: <rung> — <what re-runs against the real component>]
    exception  | EXC-NNN  | subject | census-class | why-rule-does-not-apply
    suppression| SUP-NNN  | subject | census-class | extractor-gap | fix-by

- A **rule** row's census command is its denominator — it enumerates every
  site the rule applies to; new code that adds a site is automatically in
  scope on the next run. Three forms: a ratified extractor path
  (`checks/extractors/invariant.<name>.sh`); two enumerations
  `<sites-cmd> :: <guarded-cmd>` (orphans = left minus right); or a single
  enumeration (a pure denominator the row's ledger test asserts over). The
  command may contain pipes; the statement field may not. An empty
  population is a FAILURE, never a pass (zero-denominator guard) — except
  while the rule's test is still `owed:`, when orphans AND an empty
  population report `pending` (ratified, not yet armed); materialising the
  test arms the census fail-closed.
- **State-machine variant (v0.8, §6.1).** A rule row whose statement field
  begins `state-machine <field>:` declares a transition table and is the
  landing spot for a lifecycle decision (publication status, alert
  lifecycle, consent):

      rule | RULE-NNN | state-machine <field>: draft>published published>archived | census-command | tier | test

  The declared transitions are the field's whole legal vocabulary
  (space-separated `from>to` pairs; a bare token declares a state with no
  transition, e.g. an initial state nothing transitions into). The census
  command enumerates every site that mutates or guard-reads the field,
  one line per site: `<site> <from>><to>` for a mutation, `<site> <state>`
  for a guard read. The engine convicts any site whose transition is not
  declared or whose state is outside the vocabulary — fail-closed, naming
  the site (grade brief instruction: find a state mutation outside the
  declared table). Zero-denominator, debt-awareness, and the population=1
  flag apply as for any rule row.
- A **difference** row is the only legal way for a knob to differ between
  test and prod. The census prints the full divergence table every run —
  the owner sees exactly what the green ledger did NOT validate. Every
  fake the harness substitutes is a divergence by construction — derived
  at materialisation, never waited for. A DIF that legalises a model or
  engine divergence on a golden-set item's path carries `paying-step:` —
  the deploy rung and the re-run that pays it (the golden set against
  the real component): a deferred test with a named step, never a
  permanent shrug. **The paying step `close run, profile=deployed`**
  (v0.9.3 3.3): a difference whose knob is the inline switch, a scheduler
  stand-in or the absent workers is paid by the close run's deployed pass,
  locally, and its deploy gate-2 sibling stays, narrowed to the platform
  half ("the platform's worker consumes it"); a knob whose real component
  exists only on the platform keeps `paying-step: staging`.
- An **exception** says the rule genuinely does not apply to this subject.
  Exceptions count toward the complexity law's ceremony threshold
  (CLAUDE.md §2): a rule whose exception list exceeds ~15–20% of its
  population is ceremony and is deleted.
- A **suppression** says the rule applies but the extractor cannot yet see
  the site — it never counts toward deletion and stands as a to-do against
  the extractor, printed every run. `census-class` in exception and
  suppression rows names the extractor class (`dead-path`, `divergence`,
  `reachability`, `vacuity`) for extractor orphans, and MUST name the
  specific `RULE-NNN` for a rule row's orphans — the class word is not a
  skeleton key across rules.

## Provider seam rows (v0.8 — read by checks/seams.sh)

    seam | SEAM-NNN | service | purpose | chosen: D-NNN | credentials: <held|not-yet|never> | probe: <owed | probed(YYYY-MM-DD) | unreachable-risk(reason)> | evidence: <contract-test path + captured-response path, or owed> | quirks: <one per ";", or "none yet"> [| module: <module id>]

- One row per EXTERNAL service the product depends on — payments, mail,
  feeds, search, auth, storage: anything on the other side of the network
  this repo does not own. Two discovery doors (§3.2): init's architecture
  step declares known seams (an external boundary without a row cannot be
  ratified), and checks/seams.sh rejects a staged outbound destination no
  row covers — discovery is mechanical, not remembered.
- **Born owing a probe** — same debt semantics as every other row. Two
  legal exits: pay it (`probe: probed(date)`) or declare
  `unreachable-risk(reason)` with the reason stated. Never silent coverage.
- **The probe (§3.3) comes before the first client line:** the smallest
  real calls that answer the questions — never discover a limit by
  exceeding it (that is load-testing someone else's service; where docs
  are silent, chunk conservatively). Observed shapes, error semantics, and
  identifier-namespace behavior are written into the contract tests the
  evidence field names; the captured response becomes those tests' sample
  data — the surviving, shape-scoped form of fixture provenance. Contract
  tests are ledger additions (free) and are how the probe is paid; the row
  flip `owed → probed(date)` is a law change, standalone.
- Routing per the two-channel rule: a technical quirk is logged in the
  quirks field and pinned by a contract test; a quirk touching product
  meaning ("empty response cannot be distinguished from a broken feed")
  goes to the owner as a product question, never a silent log line.
- Optional `| module: <module id>` names the module of ARCHITECTURE.md's
  module table that talks to the service (its Module column, a dotted
  label read as a path). The project viewer lists the service among that
  module's contracts; no court reads it.
- Optional trailing `| match: <tokens>` names the greppable tokens that
  identify code touching this seam (client-library import names,
  hostnames, space-separated). Absent, the service field is the match
  token. Pick tokens that will not legitimately occur otherwise — the
  vid-forbidden rule, applied here.
- checks/seams.sh (presence-gated, fail-closed): app-source additions
  matching an OWED seam's tokens are rejected naming the row (tests/ is
  exempt — contract tests are the probe's own artifact); a staged outbound
  destination covered by no seam row demands one before the code lands. A
  destination that is content, not an outbound call (a footer link), takes
  an exception row naming class `seam`.
- The grade brief carries this table with a standing instruction — find a
  behavior of this service the probe did not pin. vid-deploy's "one real
  action per provider seam" gate is these rows' re-verification, not a
  separate concept.

## Hostility rows (v0.8 §4 — read by checks/inventory.sh)

    hostility | HOS-NNN | attempt | protects: <RULE-NNN|REQ-NNN|ROW-NNN> | disable: <toggle> | test [| proved-red: <sha>]

- One row per **Tier-0 protection**: the sibling of a ratified Tier-0 rule
  row (`tier` = 0) or Tier-0 requirement, which *attempts the forbidden
  thing* against the locally running app through its real public surface,
  in the same Docker-only harness as every other ledger test. Reads confirm
  a guard is present and correct; only an attempt establishes that it
  holds. The measured class: a correct publication guard defeated by a
  different path erasing the state it read, and a rate-limit bound defeated
  by one rotated client-identity header — both present, both correct, both
  bypassed. The must-never-happen list, executed instead of trusted.
- `attempt` — one falsifiable sentence naming the forbidden thing the probe
  commits, never the guard it hopes to meet ("submit the same form twice
  concurrently, expect exactly one record", not "double-submit is guarded").
- `protects:` — the ratified protection this row is a sibling of: a
  Tier-0 rule row, a Tier-0 requirement, or a Tier-0 ROW (a ratified genus
  protection — the court resolves a ROW target to its REQ). Absent,
  the row is a sibling of nothing and is rejected.
- `disable:` — the named, reversible way that protection is turned OFF so
  the probe can be watched failing. Required; `none` and `n/a` are not
  values. It is a LOCAL mutation performed at materialisation and reverted
  in the same sitting (remove the guard clause, build without it) — never a
  runtime switch that ships. A guard with a production kill-switch is not a
  guard; the toggle is written down so the ritual can be re-run, not so the
  product can be unlocked.
- `test` — path under tests/invariants/, or `owed: <reason>`, as for any row.
- `proved-red:` is **mandatory** here, not optional as it is for a ROW row:
  a cited probe test with no proved-red is a GAP, not debt. A probe never
  observed failing is not evidence, and unlike an ordinary row it is
  evidence with the polarity that reassures.

### The bounded set

Derived mechanically from the ratified Tier-0 protections, never invented:
~one probe per Tier-0 protection (10–15 for a mid-sized product). A fixed
list — explicitly not a fuzzer, not a scanner, no generated or open-ended
input exploration. Probes beyond the ratified protections are ceremony and
are deleted under the complexity law; the way to add one is to ratify the
protection it is the sibling of. The shapes prior field runs produced,
stated as behavior so they carry to any stack:

- concurrent double-submit of the same action → exactly one record
- a replayed one-time link or token → exactly one effect, one timestamp
- a valid session for actor A requesting actor B's resource → refused, with
  an audit entry
- a transition attempted out of a state that forbids it (reject, then
  publish) → refused, whichever path sets the state
- a rotated client-identity header against a rate limit → the bound holds
- refresh mid-flow, expired-form resubmit, stale-state action → no double
  effect
- **dependency failure during the protected operation** (v0.8.1d): the
  seam the operation touches fails mid-way → the forbidden effect does
  not occur and the failure is recorded, never a silent success; the
  `disable:` toggle is the fail-closed handling itself (the measured
  class: an erasure that failed open when its store was down, whose probe
  counted residue through the pointer it had just blanked)
- **concurrency against the protected operation** (v0.8.1d): two
  simultaneous attempts → exactly one effect; the toggle is the
  serialisation guard

### The fail-first ritual (mandatory, §4.2)

A hostility probe passing proves nothing until it has been watched failing:
"refused" is equally green when the attempt was malformed and never reached
the guard at all. At materialisation, in one sitting, per probe:

1. **Prove the runner can go red** — invoke it with a selector naming a test
   that does not exist. Runners commonly exit 0 on a selection that matches
   nothing; wired that way, every probe below is a green that can never go
   red, which is worse than no probe at all. If it exits 0, fix the
   invocation before any probe is trusted.
2. **Disable** the protection by the row's own `disable:` toggle and run the
   probe. It MUST fail, and fail on its assertion about the forbidden effect
   — not on a connection error, a 404, or a fixture fault. A red for the
   wrong reason is the same false assurance in the other direction.
3. **Restore** the protection and run the probe. It MUST pass.
4. **Stamp** `proved-red: <sha>` — the commit at which step 2 was observed.

A probe with no verified failing state is REJECTED at materialisation: the
row stays `owed:` until the ritual is performed. checks/inventory.sh
enforces the mechanical half — a missing `protects:`, a missing or `none`
`disable:` toggle, and a cited test with no `proved-red` are GAPs that fail
the commit; a Tier-0 rule row with no hostility sibling is owed debt that
blocks completion (`--strict`). The honesty of steps 1–3 is the builder's,
and the row is what the graders read.

Granularity is **screen × state** — the zero-results, expired, and error
variants are where field runs leaked. Mandatory row classes, generated, not
judged: (1) every drawn screen × state, one surface row per applicable auth
state; (2) every requirement with a Fail-if, one behavior row; (3) **the
shell** in each auth state — header, footer, primary nav, error pages, empty
states; (4) reachability — every required surface reachable from an entry
point in its auth state, every default-navigation link resolves, a session
implies a sign-out control, no anonymous-only control shown authenticated or
vice versa; (5) every critical PRD journey end-to-end, one row each.

Browser-class rows (shell, reachability, journeys, the surface
instrument) are ledger tests in the engines the harness contract declares,
inside the container-only harness. **The sizing is law (v0.9.2 3.4,
R7):** ~5 shell rows + ~10 journey rows + one instrument for all screens
— written, for new projects, as a ledger test file per screen (its states
together, up to 5 rows a file; v0.9.8.1 R18), every file through the one
measure module, produced by the surface test-author pass
from the rows, the canvases and the measure module, one case per surface
row (screen × state × auth state), loading each state once per engine,
reading every load-bearing paint property in one evaluate, checking the
state's content, stray controls (the denominator: the whole page minus
the shell) and console errors, then the row's `pins:` hook on that same
loaded page. Surface rows cite their screen's file (its head carries the
row table); a surface test, or a pins hook, written by the builder is a
defect. Other new test files hold one row, or up to 5 related rows.
